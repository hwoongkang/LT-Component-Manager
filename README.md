# LT-Component-Manager

Smarter way to modify your smart components in [Glyphs](https://glyphsapp.com)

## Requirements

You need to install and log in with [LT Toolkit Manager](https://github.com/hwoongkang/LT-Toolkit-Manager) in order to use this plugin.

Without toolkit manager, it will complain that you don't have access to it.

## Usage

1. [Select glyphs](#Select-glyphs)
2. [Open component manager](#Open-component-manager)
3. [Search for smart components](#Search-for-smart-components)
4. [Select modify option](#Select-modify-option)
5. [Select align option](#Select-align-option)
6. [Fill in the values](#Fill-in-the-values)

### Select glyphs

Select glyphs in which the smart components you want to change the values are.

You can select glyphs in either the font view panel or the edit view panel.

### Open component manager

Click _Edit > Leedotype Plugins > LT Component Manager_ to open the plugin.

### Search for smart components

Search for the smart components you want to modify.

You can set the option to search for the exact match, or to include all the components that contains the keyword in their names.

### Select modify option

Select modifying option, to control how the smart component axes value should change.

Let's say you have chosen only one glyph, and you have searched only for a single component. And let's say that the component has height value of 500 now.

After you put 150 in the input textfield and by selecting:

- **Set to**  
  By selecting "set to", the value will change to 150.

- **Alter**  
  By selecting "Alter", the value will change to 650 (500 + 150)

- **Ratio**  
  By selecting "Ratio", the value will change to 750 (500 \* 150% = 500 \* 150 / 100)

### Select align option

You can also set the alignment option by selecting a square above the modify options.

### Fill in the values

This is the final and most important step while using the manager.

Fill in the values in the following textfields, to modify each axes.

Don't be too afraid, because we provide the handy undo button built in the manager.
